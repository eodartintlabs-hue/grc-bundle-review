## v1.3.0 — Sasebo

**Minor release** · October 29, 2026 · Tag `v1.3.0`

### Drop-in `scans/` folder and file selection

- Added a root **`scans/`** folder where analysts drop Tenable / AWS Inspector exports (`.csv`, `.xlsx`) and previous OPEN / CLOSED FedRAMP POA&M workbooks (`.xlsx`), so long file paths no longer need to be typed.
- Running `./grc transform` interactively lists detected files with numbers (`[1]`, `[2]`, …) and accepts either a number or a filename.
- All file inputs (`--scan` / `-s`, `--previous-open` / `-p`, `--previous-closed`, or the positional argument) search `scans/` first and match filenames case-insensitively, with or without an extension. They fall back to `testing/sample-scans/` and then to direct paths.
- `scans/` is re-checked when the analyst answers the prompt, so a file dropped in while the prompt is open is still found.

### POA&M data-integrity fixes (`scripts/transform_scans.py`)

- **Host-verified auto-close.** Before informational rows are filtered out, the engine records every scanned host (including Tenable plugin `19506`, *Nessus Scan Information*) and links `Host` / `IP Address` / `DNS Name` / `FQDN` aliases that appear together. A previous OPEN item is only closed as "Verified remediated" if its host, or an alias, was confirmed scanned. Items on unscanned hosts stay OPEN and are flagged for review, unless `--close-unscanned-hosts` is passed.
- **CISA KEV and BOD 22-01.** Tenable's `Exploit Available = Yes` is no longer treated as KEV membership. KEV status and BOD 22-01 due dates (Columns Z and AA) now come from an offline CISA KEV catalog ([`rules/cisa_kev_catalog.json`](../rules/cisa_kev_catalog.json), override with `--kev-catalog`), using CISA's own `dateAdded` and `dueDate`.
- **POA&M IDs.** The next `POAM-YYYY-NNNN` number is computed across both the previous OPEN and CLOSED workbooks, so closed IDs are never reused. Fallback matching by weakness name can no longer give two scan items the same ID. A `[WARNING]` is printed when the script runs without `-p`.
- **SLA and detection dates.** SLA dates are recalculated when duplicate rows on the same host are merged. `Plugin Publication Date` is no longer used as a fallback for the original detection date.

### Excel template handling

- All OpenXML namespace prefixes (`mc`, `x14`, `x14ac`, `x15`, `mx`, `mv`, `xm`, `xr`) are preserved instead of being renamed to `ns0`, `ns1`, ….
- Illegal XML 1.0 control characters are stripped, and cell text is capped at Excel's 32,767-character limit.
- `fullCalcOnLoad="1"` is set in `xl/workbook.xml`, `<dimension>` is updated, and cell styles are discovered from the template instead of hard-coded.
- `.xlsx` files are read with `ET.iterparse` streaming.

### New options and tests

- New flags: `--dry-run`, `--strict-fedramp-risk`, `--close-unscanned-hosts`, `--kev-catalog`.
- Added a 10-test standard-library `unittest` suite ([`testing/test_transform_scans.py`](../testing/test_transform_scans.py)) covering OpenXML round-tripping, host-verified closure, KEV lookup, and SLA recalculation.

### Docs

- Version strings updated to `v1.3.0 (Sasebo)` in `./grc`, `docs/scan-transform-guide.md`, `COMMANDS.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `README.md`, and `hygiene/*`.

> **Not in this release:** the workstation portability work (UID/GID fixes, pinned scanner image, Podman / SELinux support, `./grc doctor`) is planned for `v1.3.1`. See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

## v1.2.0 — Misawa

**Minor release** · October 20, 2026 · Tag `v1.2.0` (`c510bc3`)

### Scan-to-FedRAMP POA&M transformer

- Added [`scripts/transform_scans.py`](../scripts/transform_scans.py) (`./grc transform`), a standalone engine written only with the Python 3 standard library. It needs no Docker container, no `.bundle` file, and no `pip` installs.
- Auto-detects **Tenable** (Nessus, Tenable.sc, Tenable.io) and **AWS Inspector** exports in `.csv` or `.xlsx`, and maps each unique vulnerability and asset pair to one row across the 27 FedRAMP POA&M columns.

### Bundled FedRAMP templates

- [`templates/OPEN FedRAMP-POAM-Template.xlsx`](../templates/OPEN%20FedRAMP-POAM-Template.xlsx): Columns B–AB, data from row 5.
- [`templates/CLOSED LEGACY FedRAMP-POAM-Template.xlsx`](../templates/CLOSED%20LEGACY%20FedRAMP-POAM-Template.xlsx): Columns A–AA, data from row 3.
- The OPEN template's risk-rating dropdown and Column M (Scheduled Completion Date) formula were extended to support Critical (+30 days), High (+30), Moderate (+90), and Low (+180).

### Open-to-closed reconciliation

- Accepts a previous OPEN POA&M (`--previous-open`, or prompted).
- Findings still present keep their POA&M ID, Original Detection Date (Column L), and analyst-entered fields; Status Date (Column N) is updated.
- Findings no longer in the scan, or marked False Positive = Yes, move to the CLOSED workbook with a dated note.

### Remediation plans and SLA reporting

- If any OPEN entries lack a Remediation Plan (Column K), the analyst is asked (`y/n`) whether to draft them. Drafts include links to the Tenable plugin page, AWS ALAS advisory, AWS Inspector docs, and NVD.
- Reports how many OPEN entries are past their Scheduled Completion Date and how old each finding is, both in the terminal and in `poam_transform_summary.md`.

### Docs and samples

- Added the analyst guide [`docs/scan-transform-guide.md`](../docs/scan-transform-guide.md), sample Tenable and Inspector exports, a sample previous OPEN POA&M, and generated evidence in `testing/demo-evidence/`.
- Roadmap updated: Misawa and Sasebo swapped places, and the cloud lift and local LLM work moved to `v2.1.0+ — Kaneohe`.

## v1.1.0 — Kadena

**Minor release** · October 20, 2026 · Tag `v1.1.0` (`b2eea63`)

- **Rebrand to GRCx — "The GRC eXperience"**, replacing *GRC Bundle Review Pipeline* across documentation, CLI wrappers, and analyzer metadata (`scripts/sbom_analyzer.py`, `scripts/grc_bundle.py`).
- **Logo:** light and dark lockups in [`assets/logo/`](../assets/logo/), shown in `README.md` with a theme-adaptive `<picture>` header.
- **CLI banner:** `./grc fetch` now shows the GRCx banner and `GRCx v1.1.0 (Kadena)`.
- **New guides:** [`INSTALL.md`](../INSTALL.md) (setup through first scan, including viewing outputs in Cursor) and [`COMMANDS.md`](../COMMANDS.md) (every `./grc` command and flag).
- **Cleanup:** removed `docs/workspace-layout.md`, `docs/review-workflow.md`, and `docs/design-rules-and-aocs.md`, and shortened `README.md` Section 8 to link to the new guides.

---

## v1.0.6 — Yokosuka

**Patch (docs)** · October 19, 2026 · Tag `v1.0.6` (`bf1c799`)

- Added minimum and recommended hardware and software requirements to `README.md` Section 7 and to `docs/workspace-layout.md` (that file was later removed in `v1.1.0`).
- Added a 4-in-1 synthetic verification bundle ([`testing/demo-evidence/aoc-combo-4x/`](../testing/demo-evidence/aoc-combo-4x/)) combining AOC-02, AOC-04, AOC-07, and AOC-09. It produced 19 normalized POA&M findings across 7 NIST SP 800-53 controls.

---

## v1.0.5 — Yokosuka

**Patch (docs)** · October 19, 2026 · Tag `v1.0.5` (`48d1d34`)

- Added the first product roadmap ([`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md)) and a roadmap section in `README.md`. In this first version, Sasebo was `v1.2.0` and Misawa was `v1.3.0`; the two were swapped in `v1.2.0`.
- Added the Roadmap link to the navigation bar on every documentation page.

---

## v1.0.4 — Yokosuka

**Patch (bug fix)** · October 18, 2026 · Tag `v1.0.4` (`19c41dc`)

- **Fix:** `./grc scan` ran the seven containerized scanners and then went straight to `grc_reporter.py`, skipping `scripts/crypto_lib_scan.py` and `scripts/sbom_analyzer.py`. Full scans now run all nine engines before Phase 4 reports are generated.
- **Per-engine runs:** `./grc` and `docker/scan_orchestrator.sh` accept `--all` or `--engine <name>`. Engine names: `semgrep`, `gitleaks`, `checkov`, `syft`, `grype`, `trivy`, `oscap`, `crypto`, `sbom`. `grype` and `sbom` run `syft` first if `sbom.cdx.json` is missing.
- Added `--no-report` (skip Phase 4) and `./grc scan --help`.
- `bundle_provenance.json` and `ami_provenance.json` are now copied into `evidence/` in every scan mode.

---

## v1.0.3 — Yokosuka

**Patch (docs)** · October 18, 2026 · Tag `v1.0.3` (`48a43ff`)

- Moved synthetic test outputs into [`testing/demo-evidence/`](../testing/demo-evidence/) and added `evidence/.gitkeep`, so root `evidence/` holds only real reviews. Updated `live-demo.md`, `DATAFLOW.md`, and `GOVERNANCE.md` to match.
- Reworked the patch ledger table: removed duplicate version and codename columns, and added Commit and Author columns.

---

## v1.0.2 — Yokosuka

**Patch (docs)** · October 18, 2026 · Tag `v1.0.2` (`3445ac6`)

- Reorganized documentation into `amplifying-info/` (architecture, data flow, governance), `testing/` (test plan, live demo), and `hygiene/` (release tracking). `README.md` and `SECURITY.md` stay at the root so GitHub shows them natively.
- Updated all navigation bars, relative links, and SVG asset paths.

---

## v1.0.1 — Yokosuka

**Patch (docs)** · October 18, 2026 · Tag `v1.0.1` (`d038e81`)

- Adopted the Yokosuka codename in Git tags, docs, and the CLI banner.
- Renamed `grc-bundle Use Case.md` to [`docs/grc-bundle-use-case.md`](../docs/grc-bundle-use-case.md).
- Standardized the Git author identity on the GitHub `noreply` address.
- Added the patch ledger, release notes, and [`live-demo.md`](../testing/live-demo.md) (a presentation script covering AOC-09, AOC-10, and AOC-04).
- Added Phase 4 evidence packages for AOC-04, AOC-09, and AOC-10. These later moved to `testing/demo-evidence/` in `v1.0.3`.

---

## v1.0.0 — Yokosuka

**Beta baseline** · October 18, 2026 · Tag `v1.0.0` (`9bc27c3`)

First end-to-end beta of the **GRC Bundle & AMI Review Pipeline** (renamed GRCx in `v1.1.0`), released to designated integration testers. It targets FedRAMP High, DISA STIG, NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, and DoD RMF environments.

### Five-phase review lifecycle

1. **Pull & verify:** SHA-256 checksum and `git bundle verify` checks ([`scripts/grc_bundle.py`](../scripts/grc_bundle.py)), plus AMI KMS encryption checks ([`scripts/grc_ami.py`](../scripts/grc_ami.py)).
2. **Ephemeral restore:** read-only extraction (`chmod 0444` for bundles; `mount -o ro,noload,noexec,nosuid` for AMI snapshots) with `bundle_provenance.json` / `ami_provenance.json`.
3. **Air-gapped scan:** containerized analysis in `grc-scanner:local` with `--network none` and `/workspace:ro`.
4. **Compliance synthesis:** `poam_data.md`, `controls.md`, `ruleset_validation.md`, `scr_scn_package.json`, and `sha256sum` seals ([`scripts/grc_reporter.py`](../scripts/grc_reporter.py)).
5. **Teardown:** workspace cleanup and volume detachment (`./grc bundle clean`, `./grc ami clean`).

### Engines

- **Containerized (7):** Semgrep (37 custom rules in [`rules/custom-baseline-ruleset.yaml`](../rules/custom-baseline-ruleset.yaml)), Gitleaks, Checkov, Syft, Grype, Trivy, and OpenSCAP.
- **Host Python auditors (2):** [`scripts/crypto_lib_scan.py`](../scripts/crypto_lib_scan.py) (EOL / non-FIPS crypto libraries) and [`scripts/sbom_analyzer.py`](../scripts/sbom_analyzer.py) (SBOM-to-STIG applicability). These weren't run automatically by `./grc scan` until `v1.0.4`.

### Documentation

[`README.md`](../README.md), [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../amplifying-info/ARCHITECTURE.md), [`DATAFLOW.md`](../amplifying-info/DATAFLOW.md), [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md), [`GOVERNANCE.md`](../amplifying-info/GOVERNANCE.md), [`TESTING.md`](../testing/TESTING.md), and [`test-dummies-guide.md`](../docs/test-dummies-guide.md) (paired with [`grc-test-dummies`](https://github.com/eodartintlabs-hue/grc-test-dummies)).
